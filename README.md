# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

**Overview**
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company, building predictive models to identify at-risk customers and provide insights for improving retention.

**1. Data Preparation**
Loaded and explored the dataset.
Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
Split data into training and testing sets.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
Visualized churn rate and customer demographics (gender, partner, dependents).
Analyzed tenure and its impact on churn.
Examined churn patterns by contract type and payment method.

**3. Predictive Modeling**
Applied machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimized performance through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

**4. Model Evaluation**
Tested the best model on the test dataset.
Interpreted key factors driving churn via feature importance.
Generated ROC curves and calculated AUC for performance assessment.
